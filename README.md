# student-success-predictor
A machine learning system that will identify students success using academic and behavioral data.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a way to predict whether a student is at high, medium, or low risk of failing, from the data I have been provided. This should allow teachers to intervene before the student fails entirely.

Rather than a basic grade predictor, this system focuses on risk detection similar to real-world educational analytics.

## Dataset

This project uses the Student Performance Dataset from Kaggle containing over 1 million student records with academic, demographic, and behavioral features:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nabeelqureshitiii/student-performance-dataset

## Project Pipeline

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
5. Model Evaluation (Recall-focused for at-risk students)
6. Model Explainability (Feature Importance & SHAP)
7. Final Risk Prediction System
